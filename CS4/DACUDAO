[1] I am Dayne Martin Galenzoga Dacudao.
[2] I think that the passwords we're asked for are overrated.
[3] I don't know exactly how tall I am. 
[4] Just thinking of reading some book or handout for some subject tires me out, yet I don't mind reading it.
[5] For some reason, I keep looking for songs which were made before the 20th century- for me, they just seem better.
[6] I don't regret not being born in 80's, 90's etc. because the music sounds better now with the improving technology.
[7] Nothing beats the original, though I think there's just some covers of some music that owns some songs and it somehow makes you think otherwise.
[8] Nihongo wa wakarimasen. (I don't understand Japanese.)
[9] Somehow throughout going through with the Web Dev. Udacity course, I thought about developing ROT13 into some full-blown encryption method.
[10] I love Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5!
