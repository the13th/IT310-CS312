+ I'm a reclusive person... so I don't really fare well in crowds
+ I'm a bit of a geek *Well, mostly a mecha geek anyway, so Gundams and Transformers mostly*
+ I collect toys/model kits *In relation to the fact before this*
+ I like reading, mainly of the sci fi or medieval fantasy setting... okay anything involving magic also *Lord of the Rings, Harry potter, the Halo novels..... *
+ I'm an avid gamer *Portable and laptop gamer anyway.... no cash for them new gen consoles XD*
+ Most games I enjoy are tactical in nature *Turn based RPG's and RTS mostly, not so much on shooters given how poor I am as far as reflexes go*
+ 13 is my lucky number.... despite it being unlucky in as far as superstition goes 
+ I want to cosplay mechs someday...... now if only it wasn't very costly
+ I have a very, very short fuse and can and WILL blow up if I screw things up badly.... for some reason this happens too often for my liking
+ I enjoy listenng to music, so if you see me, expect me to have a pair of headphones on me at all times
